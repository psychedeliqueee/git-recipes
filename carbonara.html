    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Carbonara, while not being the most traditional way to make carbonara, it is one of the best ways to make it. The chicken is very juicy this way, very seasoned, while the pasta is very cheesy because of the parmesan</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounce package spaghetti</li>
        <li>4 ounce package pancetta bacon, diced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 and a half cups whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>8 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh italian parsley</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large, heavy frying pan over medium heat. Add pancetta and garlic; saute until brown and crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Whisk cream, Parmesan, egg yolks, basil, and parsley together in a large bowl until well blended.</li>
        <li>Stir chicken into the pancetta mixture until combined. Add cooked spaghetti and cream mixture. Toss over medium-low heat until chicken is heated through and sauce forms a thick coating over the spaghetti, about 4 minutes. Do not boil or the eggs will scramble. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a large, wide serving bowl.</li>
    </ol>
