    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These are the easiest, creamiest potatoes au gratin I have ever had... YUM!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds yukon gold potatoes, peeled and very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream, devided</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>freshly grated nutmeg to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups freshly shredded gruyere cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place potatoes, garlic, and salt into a large pot, fill with enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer the potatoes until tender but not mushy, 8 to 10 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer about half the potatoes to a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Pour half of the cream over the potatoes, season with black pepper and nutmeg, and sprinkle half of the Gruyere cheese onto the mixture. Top with the remaining potatoes; sprinkle again with black pepper and nutmeg. Pour on the remaining cream, and sprinkle with remaining Gruyere cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese topping is crisp and brown on top, about 1 hour.</li>
    </ol>
